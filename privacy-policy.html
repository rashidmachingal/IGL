                <li><strong>With Affiliates:</strong> We may share Your information with Our affiliates, in which case
                    we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include Our parent company
                    and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that We control or that are
                    under common control with Us.</li>
                <li><strong>With business partners:</strong> We may share Your information with Our business partners to
                    offer You certain products, services or promotions.</li>
                <li><strong>With other users:</strong> when You share personal information or otherwise interact in the
                    public areas with other users, such information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly
                    distributed outside.</li>
                <li><strong>With Your consent</strong>: We may disclose Your personal information for any other purpose
                    with Your consent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
            <p>The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in
                this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use Your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with
                our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable
                laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
            <p>The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained
                for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the
                functionality of Our Service, or We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.
            </p>
            <h3>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
            <p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any
                other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information
                may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country
                or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your
                jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your
                agreement to that transfer.</p>
            <p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an
                organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your
                data and other personal information.</p>
            <h3>Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
            <p>You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the Personal Data that We have
                collected about You.</p>
            <p>Our Service may give You the ability to delete certain information about You from within the Service.</p>
            <p>You may update, amend, or delete Your information at any time by signing in to Your Account, if you have
                one, and visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage Your personal information. You
                may also contact Us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that You have
                provided to Us.</p>
            <p>Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or
                lawful basis to do so.</p>
            <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
            <h4>Business Transactions</h4>
            <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be transferred.
                We will provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different
                Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h4>Law enforcement</h4>
            <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do
                so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).
            </p>
            <h4>Other legal requirements</h4>
            <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
                <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
                <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
                <li>Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public</li>
                <li>Protect against legal liability</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
            <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over
                the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially
                acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are
                aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We
                have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent,
                We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>
            <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires
                consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.
            </p>
            <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third
                party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the
                Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>
            <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of
                any third party sites or services.</p>
            <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new
                Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
            <p>We will let You know via email and/or a prominent notice on Our Service, prior to the change becoming
                effective and update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy
                Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
